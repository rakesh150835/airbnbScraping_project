When I'm not traveling for work, I reside in the guesthouse, accompanied by my friendly black lab, Hawk. Sometimes, I'm away, and another Airbnb guest might be staying on the property during such instances. While each space is separate and private, you might cross paths with fellow guests. If you do, don't hesitate to offer a friendly 'hi!' as you enjoy the communal charm of our property.Please note that while our property is listed as an ‘entire house,’ it includes a separate, self-contained basement apartment and garage storage and maintenance area. The basement unit is infrequently occupied. When it is, it is typically only by our property manager and his young son when necessary. They are fully committed to respecting our guests’ privacy and ensuring a peaceful stay. This arrangement has been a key part of maintaining the high-quality experience we’ve proudly offered for over seven years. We appreciate your understanding and are always available to address any questions or concerns you may have.---------NOTE: We require that all guests staying at the property are accounted for in the booking details, primarily for safety and insurance purposes.

Rest assured, cleanliness and comfort are our top priorities. Please note that air conditioning is not available; however, Seattle's typically mild climate is enjoyable year-round. For your convenience, we offer optional services such early/late check-ins, parking, and early/late luggage pick-up for a nominal fee. Simply reach out to us by 8 pm at least a day before check-in to arrange these extras through the Airbnb resolution center.Registration numberSTR-OPLI-24-000011",NA,NA,NA,"['https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/8612fe90-7f8d-42c7-a0ed-776b6a94448a.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/55d2b31d-b445-4d54-9042-3c47d4cbee31.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/8d1d621f-3f65-4e5d-9c98-233f636b981b.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/1f4c1732-1ad8-400f-891c-ae151544b6fa.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/39cb411b-cca6-420d-9c03-b8a1106260e8.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/38240b14-d28e-4ac3-a0e0-a7c52d45128e.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/82484b5f-127e-4172-b4b2-9b30743fde7e.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/e7a7f77b-a2ec-4df2-bcbf-6fa4453ffc82.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/9019abf0-fcfc-4606-8295-a8f28959a745.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/ae0b55e8-9da9-468d-9432-98f0739e46a8.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/90078663-b0ec-4838-ba7c-42e29a058360.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/42b7afe1-0921-4a4b-841f-b4d1169af45b.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/e7fbcbe4-373f-4831-935a-354d44529048.jpeg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6MTE5NTA3OTMzOTE2NDM5NzI1Nw%3D%3D/original/9396407a-69c8-4c4e-938a-14f80c95f2cf.jpeg?im_w=720']"
