If you do not have time to read through this information, or do not like following rules or instructions, or if you do not respond to messages, then please book another place. \n\nWe find that being clear about these rules up front creates a harmonious and positive experience for our guests and for us as hosts. It is important to us to make sure our place is a good fit for your stay before we approve any reservations. Having these guidelines is what allows us to feel comfortable continuing to offer our home as a vacation rental to our wonderful guests. We fully understand, accept, and respect that our place and the way we do things is not a fit for everyone. \n\n-Adults only please\n\n-No outside guests are permitted without checking with us first. \n\n-We request that our guests download the Airbnb app on their phones and make sure notifications are turned on so we can easily reach you and communicate before and during your stay if needed. Please be respectful of our time and respond to any questions that we send you promptly (within 24 hours.) We always do our best to respond quickly to our guests. \n\n-You have your own private backyard complete with swimming pool, tiki bar, sauna, and outdoor shower, and outdoor bathtub for two. This is a great place to stay if you want a luxurious relaxing vacation however, keep in mind this is not a party house. If you want to be able to be loud and yell and party in the backyard without regard for the noise volume of your group, this property is definitely not a fit, as we need to be respectful of our wonderful neighbors and our vacation rental permit and county rules. Noise from vacation rentals is a very contentious topic in our area with neighbors so please be respectful. \n\nWe like to be very clear about this up front so there are no misunderstandings later during your stay. Lounging, relaxing, laughing and talking by the pool during the day in a normal voice is welcomed. Quiet hours are 9:30 pm to 7 am. At night, please do not stay in the pool house / tiki bar / shower area / backyard talking past 9:30 pm, our neighbors go to bed early and sleep with their windows open. Our neighborhood is extremely quiet at night, so any sound from the backyard travels easily. \n\n-Please do not play music in the backyard or pool house, and if our neighbors can hear your music playing from inside the house, then it is too loud. There is a county wide ordinance that there can be no amplified music (including boom boxes and speakers on phones) outdoors at any vacation rentals in Sonoma at any time. \n\n-Reservation is for 2 people, 2 additional guests can be added for $50 per person per night up to a max of 4 people. Please be honest and do not try to sneak extra guests or pets into our home without asking us ahead of time. Please tell us at the time of your reservation if you are planning to bring a pet or not. \n\n-Please always close the hideaway screen doors when leaving the French doors open downstairs, otherwise, a lot of flying insects will get into the house and are difficult and time consuming to catch afterwards and they may bother you during your stay as well if they are indoors (mosquitos, flies, wasps, etc).\n\n-Please leave curtains open part of the day so our plants can get some light. \n\n-No candles or flames on the property. Electric candles are provided. \n\n-We are an eco-friendly property and some of our guests are sensitive to strong perfumes so please refrain from using synthetic perfumes or cologne during your stay, unless they are all natural or made from essential oils - we love that stuff!\n\n-We are messy eaters ourselves, so if you want to eat or drink on the white sofas, please cover the sofas with the linen sofa covers provided first. If you stain the sofa and we need to remove and bleach the white slipcovers after your stay, we charge an extra $75 for our cleaner\u2019s time to do so. Please pre-treat any stains you create on the sofa with the stain remover in the laundry closet. If you want to wash them yourself while you are there to avoid the extra cleaning charge, please message us for instructions on how to do this. \n\n-Please only use the black wash cloths provided to remove make-up, do not use the white towels for make-up removal or to wipe up spills. There are \"work\" towels in the laundry closet on top of the washing machine, feel free to get those as dirty and stained as you wish. \n\n-No smoking is permitted anywhere on the property or in front of property or backyard. Many of our neighbors are sensitive to cigarette smoke so if you wish to smoke please do so off property. Light cannabis use is ok in the backyard. \n\n-We do allow commercial photo and video shoots, but only if they are specifically approved, so please inquire if interested and tell us about your project, otherwise, no photo or video shoots permitted. \n\n-If you are coming for your wedding and plan to have anyone come to the house, please discuss with us first. \n\n-Please notify us if something gets broken even if it is something small, so we know to replace it, and please let us know if you notice something is not working properly during your stay or if something gets stained. \n\n-Check in is 3:00 pm. Check out is by 11:00 am sharp. Note that we are almost always booked solid, so we are not able to accommodate early check in or late check out requests. If by rare chance there is not a guest the night before your arrival, we will let you know automatically if you can check in early. Otherwise, please adhere to check in and check out times above. We always text guests as soon as the cleaners are done on day of arrival to let you know if you can come a little bit earlier. We are always happy to welcome you early if we can. \n\n-Guests acknowledge the following: \n1. That the pool is solar heated only and therefore only works well when it is very hot out from late May to early September depending on the weather. The pool is operational in the winter/ spring/ fall, but it is not heated at all and will be cold. In the summer, we have the solar turned all the way up and can not make it more warm than it is. We do have two pool floats that allow you to float in your clothes and not touch the water, these are great for cooler months. \n2. There is no outdoor grill at this property due to fire hazards. (There is a great indoor grill on top of the fridge) \n3. This property is located within a neighborhood (which is normally very quiet and is on a dead end street) however, occasionally neighbors may be working on their house, someone may be doing landscaping, children might be playing on the street, etc and that we as hosts can not control normal neighborhood noise that may happen during your stay. \n4. The house is on a well, so you may notice a slight sulfur smell in the water sometimes, we do have a robust $12K whole house water filter, and an additional reverse osmosis drinking water filter but if you are not used to well water, you may still notice a slight well water smell sometimes. The outdoor irrigation is not filtered and comes straight from the well, so you may notice the sulfur smell being stronger in the backyard when the irrigation is running. \n5. We have a two person outdoor bathtub. (Not a hot tub as listed in amenities, Airbnb told us to check the hot tub amenity but disclose it is a bathtub not a hot tub in our listing)\n\n-Pool Rules\n\u2022 Swim at your own risk. Guests assume all liability and responsibility for use of the pool. \n\u2022 For your safety, no diving in the pool\n\u2022 No Glass in backyard area pool /shower/ bathtub area (use plastic glasses above the stove) \n\u2022 No Swimming if intoxicated\n\u2022 Please do not leave pool floats on the ground as the dirt will stain them and please do not drag them across the dirt/ground when taking them out of the pool.\n\u2022 Please use the seagrass mat at the pool steps to wipe of the decomposed granite/gravel from your feet before entering the pool. \n\n-Sauna Rules\n\u2022 Use sauna at your own risk. Guests assumes all liability and responsibility for use of sauna. \n\u2022 Do not use sauna while intoxicated. \n\u2022 Drink plenty of water and do not stay in longer then 20 minutes at a time. \n\u2022 Only use grey towels inside sauna while using the sauna. (do not use white towels from the bathroom) Wash and dry grey sauna sweat towels on hot cycle after using. (Pool towels are in the black cabinet in the kitchen and also in the pool house in the summer. You can use any of the towels you wish for the outdoor shower or bathtub) \n\n-Our home has an entrance video ring camera floodlight for added security and to assist our guests in check in if needed.\n\n**WOW holy smokes that was a lot of rules! If you got this far and all sounds good and you still want to stay here, then yay, you are exactly the kind of guest we want to host! Now it\u2019s time to relax and enjoy your vacation! \ud83c\udf1e\n\n....Oh wait, if you want to bring a pet take a breath and keep reading...you are almost done!.....\n_________________________________________________________\n\nPET RULES\n(you only need to review this section if you want to bring a pet with you) \n\n-We love dogs! We know ourselves how hard it is to find vacation rentals that allow pets. So we decided to allow pets for now but with some conditions. Please inquire about any pets you are interested in bringing. Well behaved, quiet, mellow, fully potty trained pets will be considered. When you email us, please tell us about your pet and confirm you have read and agree to the house and pet rules around bringing a pet with you. \n\n-If you have high energy rambunctious dogs or a puppy, so sorry but this is not the right place for you. (Large mellow dogs are fine though) \n\n-**Very Important** Please walk your dog to go potty before letting them in the backyard and do not let them use the backyard area as a bathroom. There is a beautiful dog walking path one block from the cottage or you can walk them down to the street to the right out the front door, or you can just let them do a quick pee on the tree just outside the front door before letting them into the backyard each time. \n\nWe have had issues with this and will have to stop allowing dogs if guests do not respect this house rule. If your dog does have an accident in the backyard, please pick it up, use the pet spray in the laundry closet and hose it down with water. If we see or smell urine or dog poop in the backyard after your stay, we will charge an additional $100 cleaning fee. We have a small backyard and it is not an appropriate area for dogs to use as a bathroom as it starts to smell very quickly. If you are not able to stop them from going to the bathroom in the backyard then please keep them inside. Thank you.\n\n-No dogs are allowed in the pool at anytime. If you know your dog is a water dog and you can't keep them out of the pool, then this is not the right house to stay at. When dogs go into the pool, it brings a lot of decomposed granite into the pool and our pool cleaners won\u2019t clean it out because it takes too much time and it scratches our hardwood floors too. For your dog's safety, please do not leave your dog unattended in the backyard with the pool. Dogs who are not familiar with pools can accidentally fall into them. \n\n-Pets must be free of fleas. \n\n-Please trim your dogs nails before arrival so they do not scratch the hardwood floors. \n\n-We require that the white sofas are covered with the provided linen covers if you bring pets because we know how our own dogs can be rough on a white sofa. As long as the sofa and bed covers are on, dogs are welcome to sit on the furniture. (We automatically put on the linen covers for you before your arrival if you are bringing a pet.) Please put a work towel down on any outdoor furniture before letting your dog get onto any of the furniture in the tiki bar. \n\n-If you want to leave your pet alone in the cottage and have done this a lot without any issues, this is ok please but please keep your cell phone on you and your airbnb messages notifications turned on so we can reach you if needed. Dogs must be quiet and not be constantly barking.\n\n-If you go on a walk and it is muddy or raining, please wipe your dogs feet at the door. We will provide wipes for you in the hallway under the bench.\n\n-Please make sure your dog is friendly and on a leash during walks, we have a lot of other friendly dogs in the neighborhood and want to make sure everyone gets along during your stay. \n\n-If there is any damage caused by your pet, you will be required to pay for it. If you have a dog who has has accidents in the house please use doggy diapers, otherwise you will be charged for anything that is damaged. \n\n-We require a one time pet cleaning fee of $50 per pet per stay. \n\n-Please note: Two indoor dog beds as well as an outdoor dog bed are provided. Dog bowls are also provided.", "general": [{"title": "Checking in and out", "values": [{"title": "Check-in: 3:00 pm \u2013 10:00 pm", "icon": "SYSTEM_CLOCK"}, {"title": "Checkout before 11:00 am", "icon": "SYSTEM_CLOCK"}, {"title": "Self check-in with keypad", "icon": "SYSTEM_CHECK_IN"}]}, {"title": "During your stay", "values": [{"title": "4 guests maximum", "icon": "SYSTEM_FAMILY"}, {"title": "Pets allowed", "icon": "SYSTEM_PETS"}, {"title": "No parties or events", "icon": "SYSTEM_NO_EVENTS"}, {"title": "No smoking", "icon": "SYSTEM_SMOKING_NOT_ALLOWED"}]}]}, "host": {"id": "13648115", "name": "Hosted by Trinette + Chris"}, "sub_description": {"title": "Entire home in Graton, California, United States", "items": ["4 guests", "1 bedroom", "2 beds", "2 bathrooms"]}, "amenities": [{"title": "Scenic views", "values": [{"title": "Pool view", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_POOL", "available": true}]}, {"title": "Bathroom", "values": [{"title": "Bath", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_BATHTUB", "available": true}, {"title": "Hair dryer", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_HAIRDRYER", "available": true}, {"title": "Cleaning products", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_CLEANING_SUPPLIES", "available": true}, {"title": "Public Goods shampoo", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_SHAMPOO", "available": true}, {"title": "Public Goods conditioner", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_SHAMPOO", "available": true}, {"title": "Public Goods and Homemade local soap from Soap Cauldron body soap", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_SOAP", "available": true}, {"title": "Bidet", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_TOILET_BIDET", "available": true}, {"title": "Outdoor shower", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_SHOWER", "available": true}, {"title": "Hot water", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_HOT_WATER", "available": true}, {"title": "Shower gel", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_SOAP", "available": true}]}, {"title": "Bedroom and laundry", "values": [{"title": "Free washer \u2013 In unit", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_WASHER", "available": true}, {"title": "Free dryer \u2013 In unit", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_DRYER", "available": true}, {"title": "Essentials", "subtitle": "Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper", "icon": "SYSTEM_TOILETRIES", "available": true}, {"title": "Hangers", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_HANGERS", "available": true}, {"title": "Bed linen", "subtitle": "White 100% linen sheets linen", "icon": "SYSTEM_BLANKETS", "available": true}, {"title": "Extra pillows and blankets", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_PILLOW", "available": true}, {"title": "Room-darkening blinds", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_BLACKOUT_SHADES", "available": true}, {"title": "Iron", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_IRON", "available": true}, {"title": "Clothes storage: wardrobe and chest of drawers", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_WARDROBE", "available": true}]}, {"title": "Entertainment", "values": [{"title": "Ethernet connection", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_CABLE", "available": true}, {"title": "55-inch HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_TV", "available": true}, {"title": "Exercise equipment: yoga mat", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_GYM", "available": true}, {"title": "Books and reading material", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_BOOK", "available": true}]}, {"title": "Family", "values": [{"title": "Board games", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_BOARD_GAMES", "available": true}]}, {"title": "Heating and cooling", "values": [{"title": "Central air conditioning", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_SNOWFLAKE", "available": true}, {"title": "Indoor fireplace: electric", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_FIREPLACE", "available": true}, {"title": "Ceiling fan", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_FAN_CEILING", "available": true}, {"title": "Portable fans", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_FAN_PORTABLE", "available": true}, {"title": "Heating", "subtitle": "", "icon": "SYSTEM_THERMOMETER", "available": true}]}, {"title": "Home safety", "values": [{"title": "Exterior security cameras on property", "subtitle": "Our home front entrance has video ring floodlight cameras for added security and to assist with guest\u2019s check in if needed.

neighborhood of Graton. Graton is a small town filled with artists and environmentally minded people. We have very friendly neighbors. Some of our immediate neighbors are: metal sculpture artist, florist, pottery artist, textile artist and painter, photographer, animal activist, jewelry maker, montessori teacher, butterfly cultivator, art gallery manager, solar power business owner, shaman, backyard farmers and homesteaders, well you get the idea:) <br /><br />Please note that the town of Graton is located in a rural setting, but the cottage itself is in a residential neighborhood with neighbors close by. Most of the time the neighborhood is very quiet and we live on a dead end street, but occasionally a neighbor may have a gathering during the day (extremely rare), or someone may be doing some construction or repair work on their house, kids may be playing, or someone may be doing landscaping, etc. In other words, there are direct close neighbors so if you are looking for a remote rural property that is silent with no neighbors this is not it. <br /><br />Please be aware that we live in a rural area. You may hear crickets or even frogs at night. You may see squirrels jumping in trees next to the house. You may see wild turkeys, quail, deer, bats, hawks, or even an owl here and there either down on the nature trail or just walking down the street. You may see a beautiful red dragonfly drinking from the pool, ladybugs or even a spider or hummingbird on occasion in the backyard. In the spring, summer, or fall you may see some paper wasps (not aggressive unless they are attacked) or bees here and there on plants or flying around in the backyard and in the surrounding neighborhood. Leave them alone and they will leave you alone, we have never been stung the whole time we have lived here and a guest has never been stung either. If you are allergic though, you should stay elsewhere to be safe.<br /><br />We regularly check for paper wasp nests in the summer and get rid of them Immediately but if you are in this west county area you may still see some flying around here and there outside in the summer. We do go to great lengths to do everything we can to control them on our property but obviously we can never be totally in control of nature. If you are someone that needs a 100% controlled environment without any of these \"nature\" elements, then please find a different property that is more suitable to your needs. Also, please remember to look up and enjoy the stars at night, they are bigger and brighter here!<br /><br />The cottage is located in the heart of it all. Countless wineries / vineyards in the area to go wine tasting. Five minute walk to downtown Graton restaurants such as The Underwood, and Willowood. Five minute walk to the fabulous Bowman Cellars Wine Tasting Room which is three blocks away. Red Car and Dutton and many other great wineries are a quick five minute drive from the cottage. <br /><br />Five minute drive to the Barlow and the town of Sebastopol. Five minutes to Forestville. Ten minutes to Occidental. Fifteen minute drive to Guerneville. Ten minutes to Russian River. 20 minute drive to the beach (Bodega Bay) 25 minutes to Healdsburg (take the back way, very pretty drive)."}, {"title": "Getting around", "content": "Downtown Graton restaurant and bars and wine tasting room are a five minute walk from the cottage.

Water lovers can enjoy quick access to beautiful beaches, and some of the most scenic islands in California are just a short boat ride away. Hikers will find endless trails with towering views of the Pacific. Add since the Mesa is only 2 miles from Downtown Santa Barbara, you're only moments away from world-class fine dining, nightlife, trendy eateries, fantastic shopping destinations, and the beautiful Mediterranean-style architecture of the city. Come visit our Beach cottage and you\u2019ll quickly understand why \"The Mesa\" in Santa Barbara is so beloved by locals and travelers around the globe. <br /><br />If you\u2019re an outdoor lover, here are 9 ways that you can get the most out of Santa Barbara getaway while visiting our Beach Cottage on The Mesa. <br /><br />1) THE DOUGLAS PRESERVE! (A must see)<br /><br />The best view in Santa Barbara! This beautiful, undeveloped open space has numerous trails and is a hugely popular place for walking dogs because they are allowed off leash. The bluff-top oceanfront position of the park is a great location to watch for whales and dolphins. This large open-space that was donated to the city of Santa Barbara sits above Hendry's Beach Features: Alcohol Allowed, Biking, Hiking Trail, Parking On Street, Passive Open Spaces, Views, Wildlife and Birding<br /><br />2) THE BEACH! <br /><br />A day at the beach doesn\u2019t necessarily mean just lying around\u2014although there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Santa Barbara has a wide variety of beaches to suit many moods - but non are better than the beaches on The Mesa near our Beach Cottage! Leadbetter Beach is the hot spot for surfing, boogie boarding, and swimming - Just a 5 minute walk from our house! While the west-facing Butterfly Beach may be the best place to watch a sunset. If you want to get in a game of volleyball, East Beach is the place to be. It also offers bike rentals, playgrounds, cafes, and other beach amenities. Do you have dogs??? Arroyo Burro Beach is a dog-friendly beach on the Mesa that\u2019s an excellent beachcombing spot.<br /><br /><br />3) SURFING!<br /><br />Santa Barbara features some of the best surf breaks in the world, which is why many of the top names in the sport make the town their home. You can watch the top dogs in action or take to the waves yourself. Rincon Point, known in the surf community as the \"Queen of the Coast,\" features waves that travel for up to half a mile. Leadbetter Point (a short walk from our Beach Cottage) features smaller breakers just west of Santa Barbara Harbor and is perfect for those just learning the sport. Campus Point at the University of California is another mellower spot for visitors to get up on a board and become a part of that famous surf culture.<br /><br />4) SHORELINE PARK! <br /><br />Just a 5 minute walk from our Beach Cottage! Amazing! Enjoy the most beautiful and peaceful setting right on the ocean with views of the mountains and the city. Plenty of picnic tables and lots of space to walk, skate or run.<br /><br />5) CYCLING!<br /><br />Cycling is a great way to explore The Santa Barbara. Bring your bike and enjoy comfortable beach cruises or challenge yourself by traveling through the mountains. One of the most iconic climbs for road cyclists in Southern California is Gibraltar, a nine mile ride that features more than 3,000 feet of climbing. Local cyclists refer to it as the Alpe d\u2019Huez of Santa Barbara, recalling the famous mountain stage of the Tour de France. Mountain bikers have lots of options when it comes to going off-road. Stay on The Mesa and explore Elings Park, which features about five miles of singletrack trails that are perfect for beginners. Serious riders will want to check out Jesusita and its 7 miles of trails in the mountains just outside of town. Be prepared for long climbs and some technical section of trail. Want a more relaxed ride? Visit the Mesa's favorite ocean-view park - Shoreline Park!<br /><br />6) STAND-UP PADDLEBOARDING!<br /><br />You won\u2019t find a more scenic place to stand up on the water than The Mesa in Santa Barbara. Both the Santa Barbara Adventure Company and Cal Coast Adventures offer both rentals and lessons at several area beaches. (They can also help with rentals/lessons for kayaking and surfing as well.) One of the post popular spots is Santa Barbara Harbor, which features calm waters and sandy beaches. After your ride, stop by the Chuck\u2019s Waterfront Grill or the Shoreline Beach Cafe for a well-earned meal.<br /><br />7) GOLF! <br /><br />Santa Barbara features three spectacular golf courses that are among the most scenic in the country. The Robert Trent Jones Jr.-designed Rancho San Marcos sits in the valley of the Santa Ynez Mountains amid century-old oaks and historic ranch buildings. The Glen Annie Golf Club is in the foothills just outside the city. The front nine holes feature lakes and water hazards while the back nine on the mountain feature ocean and channel views. Finally the Sandpiper Golf Club, named by Golf Digest as one of the top 100 public courses in the country, features a links-style course with ocean and mountain views on every hole.<br /><br />8) SAILING! <br /><br />Let the wind do the work while you enjoy the views while out on a sailboat. Start at Santa Barbara Harbor and you\u2019ll be able to explore the coastline, the Santa Barbara Channel and the Channel Islands National Park. Regular northwest winds make this an excellent spot both novice boaters and experienced sailors. Santa Barbara Sailing offers both instruction as well as private and public cruises. From mid-February to mid-May, take a whale-watching cruise to spot the majestic Pacific Gray Whales.<br /><br />9) SANTA BARBARA BOTANIC GARDENS!<br /><br />Just a short drive from The Mesa! Get to know more about the area\u2019s plant life at the Santa Barbara Botanic Gardens. You\u2019ll find more than 1,000 different native California plants in this 78 acre preserve that\u2019s also a world-class center for research. You can take docent-led tour to find out more, or simply enjoy the hiking everything from cool Redwood forests to sandy desert terrain on your own."}], "highlights": [{"title": "Self check-in", "subtitle": "Check yourself in with the smartlock.", "icon": "SYSTEM_CHECK_IN"}, {"title": "Easton is a Superhost", "subtitle": "Superhosts are experienced, highly rated Hosts.", "icon": "SYSTEM_SUPERHOST"}, {"title": "Free cancellation for 48 hours", "subtitle": "Get a full refund if you change your mind.", "icon": "SYSTEM_CALENDAR"}], "description": "Newly remodeled 3b/3ba home with spa - located 2 blocks from the beach!
